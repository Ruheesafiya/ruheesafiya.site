# About

I am Ruhee Safiya and I am a Network Security Engineer by profession.I have about 6 years of experience in supporting customers and helping in resolving their network and security related issues.I love to dig into customer problems and solve them efficiently. I always put customer at the center of all that I do. 

Started my career as a network security engineer in 2015 where I specialized in email security , navigated my interest towards firewalls and now I troubleshoot on SD WAN technology. I think I am consistently learning and scaling because I never settle.

Communication is my strong suit.Communicating in a way that persuades and convinces customers comes to me with ease. I enjoy interacting with clients from various parts of the world.
